# 2048 Reinforcement Learning

A multi-part project that implements reinforcement learning in pytorch to "teach" a computer to play the game 2048.

See my 1st [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2019/10/11/2048-part-1/) of the project (covering the game itself).

A 2nd blog post will follow, once analysis is completed.
