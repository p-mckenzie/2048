# 2048 Reinforcement Learning

A multi-part project that implements reinforcement learning in pytorch to "teach" a computer to play the game 2048.

### Part 1 - Game Implementation
See my 1st [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2019/10/11/2048-part-1/), which covers my implementation of the game using only numpy.

To load a jupyter notebook and play my version:

### Part 2 - Reinforcement Learning
This is still in progress!
See my 2nd [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2019/12/30/2048-part-2/), which covers my logical approach to reinforcement learning and details the parameters necessary for using the `NeuralNetwork` class in `network.py`.
