# 2048 Reinforcement Learning

A multi-part project that implements reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo simulations to "teach" a computer to play the game 2048.

### Part 1 - Game implementation
See my 1st [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2019/10/11/2048-part-1/), which covers my implementation of the game using only numpy.

Relevant notebook, which allows you to play my implementation of 2048 with a rough UI:
```
+-- Interactive game demo.ipynb
```

This notebook can be loaded via binder:

### Part 2 - Reinforcement learning
See my 2nd [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2019/12/30/2048-part-2/), which covers my logical approach to reinforcement learning and details the parameters necessary for using the `NeuralNetwork` class in `network.py`.

Relevant notebook:
```
+-- Pytorch results.ipynb
```

### Part 3 - Monte Carlo tree search
See my 3rd [blog post](https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2020/04/23/2048-part-3/), which covers my implementation of Monte Carlo tree search to play 2048.

Relevant notebook:
```
+-- Monte Carlo results.ipynb
```
